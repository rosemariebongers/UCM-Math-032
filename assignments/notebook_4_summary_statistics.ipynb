    "We're almost finished establishing some of our big techniques in simulation. We've learned how to simulate easy-to-describe events (like coin flips and dice rolls), and in the last notebook we learned how to generate exponentially distributed random numbers through a change of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll take one last look at simulation for a while -- we'll keep generating random data and studying it. Our next step will be to study actual real-world data sets and analyze them statistically. But we need one last detail: how to describe the *summary statistics* of a data set so that we can give a high-level overview of the data. We'll also get more experience working with normally distributed data. Happily, Python has a way to do that: `random.gauss()`. It's called this because normal distributions are also referred to as *Gaussian,* after Carl Friedrich Gauss."
