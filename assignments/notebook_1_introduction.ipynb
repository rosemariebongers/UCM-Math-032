    "<h2> Introduction to using Jupyter </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to give you an introduction to using Jupyter. This is a programming platform that we'll be using throughout Math 032 this semester; although you won't be doing too much coding, there will be assignments where you need to write or modify code snippets so that we can use Jupyter's computational abilities to answer questions in probability and statistics. Since this is a heavily applied course with a lot of real-world applications, it's especially important to be able to use computational tools to solve problems that are beyond the scope of pen-and-paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our Jupyter notebooks mix markdown (that's what this cell is -- really, it's just fancy text with a little bit of formatting!) and Python code. You can execute the code in any cell by either clicking the `run` button above this block, or by pressing `Ctrl-Enter` or `Cmd-Enter`. In a typical notebook, you'll be given some templates or code to modify to a particular usage; you shouldn't have to write things from scratch, but rather edit previously given material.\n",

    "This notebook has a couple of questions that introduce you to the process of using Python code to answer questions, along with the particular syntax. If you're interested in learning more about the details of coding in Python, [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) is a great starting point.\n",
