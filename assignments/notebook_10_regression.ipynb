We'll analyze weather data for Merced sourced from the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=hnx); the file `march_weather.csv` contains the high and low temperatures for each day of March, 2024. \n",

In this case our independent variable *x* will be the number of days into March and our dependent variable *y* will be the temperature on that day. Let's get everything initialized:"
