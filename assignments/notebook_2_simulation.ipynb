    "One of the most powerful tools we have in understanding probability is to *simulate* an experiment many times; this gives us a lot of information about the long-term behavior of a model. Frequently, the best way to do this is by programming it -- we run thousands or millions of trials and gather a large amount of data regarding the typical outcomes, the average behavior or properties of a system, and more. \n",

    "In this notebook, we'll explore how we can simulate dice rolls using Python and generate and analyze random data for this purpose. The code blocks below will simulate throwing multiple dice, recording their outcomes, and doing computations with them."

    "<h3> Simulating dice rolls: the code </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's basic way to generate random numbers is called a *uniform random variable*: it generates a number between $0$ and $1$ without any bias towards one part of the interval. No one number is more likely as an outcome than any other number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this to do other random experiments too! If we generate a random number between $0$ and $1$, we can interpret it as a die roll as follows: if the number is between $0$ and $1/6$, it's a $1$; if the number is between $1/6$ and $2/6$, it's a $2$; and so on. An equivalent way to do this is to take our random number (e.g. $0.42$), multiply by $6$ and add $1$ ($0.42 \\cdot 6 + 1 = 3.52$), and round down (so we rolled a $3$). This will generate any number from $1$ to $6$ with equal probability -- just like rolling a die!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's code that does that. It's a bit more adaptible -- we set a variable `num_sides` that can be changed, rather than just $6$ sides. The logic is the same, though; let's roll a die ten times:"
