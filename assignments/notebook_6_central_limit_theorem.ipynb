    "<h1> Exploring the Central Limit Theorem </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to explore the central limit theorem numerically. In class, we've seen that the theorem says that as $N \\to \\infty$, an appropriately scaled average of $N$ IID random variables will converge to a normal distribution. A natural question that comes up is how large $N$ should be in order to use the central limit theorem accurately and efficiently: if $N$ is too small, then the limit is a bad approximation and if $N$ is too large, we require too much data to be practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll explore averages of exponential random variables; remember that these frequently occur in waiting-time examples, and there are many, many real-world systems that rely on knowing how quickly randomly arriving events happen. One such case is right here - this is core to how computer networks work!\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> An approximation </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you average 30 exponential random variables each having distribution $\\operatorname{Exp}(1/10)$, you can approximate the average as $\\operatorname{N(10, 100/30)}.$ This is because the underlying distribution has mean $10$ and variance $100$; remember that the variance of the average is $\\sigma^2 / n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also just directly simulate $P(\\overline{X}_{30} > 14)$ by generating exponential random variables. The code below does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem estimate for the probability is about $1.4\\%$, while the simulated sum of $30$ exponential variables is around $2.2\\%$ (using $10^6$ trials). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although these numbers are on the same scale (each representing a fairly unlikely outcome that's not too extreme), they are still off by nearly $60\\%$. This is because $30$ is a small number of trials, and the central limit theorem improves as we take a larger number of trials."
