    "<h2> Exploring confidence intervals </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we're going to experiment a bit with confidence intervals and generating them from data. One of the most subtle things about confidence intervals is that they do *not* represent the probability that a parameter $\\theta$ is in a particular interval $(\\ell, u)$ -- it either is or it isn't. What *is* true is that if we generate a large number of confidence intervals at level $\\gamma$, then they should contain the parameter with probability $\\gamma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate this with our standard normal. We'll do the following as a single trial:\n",
    "* Generate $30$ normally distributed numbers from an $N(0, 1)$ distribution using `random.gauss(0, 1)`.\n",
    "* Compute the mean of these $30$ data points and then the corresponding $95\\%$ confidence interval $(\\overline{x}_{30} \\pm 1.96 / \\sqrt{30})$.\n",
    "* Count this as a success if $0$ is in the confidence interval, because $0$ is the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then carry out $100,000$ trials of this and see how close we came:"

Estimate the corresponding confidence level; is it higher or lower than $95\\%$? Does this match your expectation?\n",
